# Example MERN stack app

This repo is an example of a simple MERN application containing CRUD functionality and database interaction using Mongoose and Express. 

## Setup

Create a .env file in the server directory to store your preferred API port and your MongoDB database route with the following constants:

`API_PORT = 3001`
`DB_ROUTE = 'your db route here'`

Then navigate to the server directory
`cd ./server`
 and run
`npm install && npm start`

Then navigate to the client directory
`cd ./client`
and run
`npm install && npm start`
